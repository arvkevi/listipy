> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Known Issues

The `listipy` extension needs help with unit tests. I am not proficient in TypeScript, so it has been a slow process to get tests working. The framework exists, but does not test anything useful at the moment.
